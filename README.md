# Continuous Contextual Consistency (C3) in Generative Language Models: A Case Study with FountainAI

## Abstract

This paper presents Continuous Contextual Consistency (C3), a framework to enhance generative language models by providing persistent, contextually relevant memory. We demonstrate its implementation in FountainAI, a platform for managing storytelling elements. By integrating subdomain-specific APIs, FountainAI achieves scalable and efficient context management, improving long-term interaction coherence and user experience.

## Implementation of C3 in FountainAI

The implementation of C3 within FountainAI involves several key components:

1. **Subdomain-Specific APIs**: The system is divided into three main APIs, each responsible for distinct functionalities:
   - Core Story Management API ([Link to OpenAPI Documentation](https://Contexter.github.io/FountainAI-API-Docs/docs/core.html))
   - Character Management API ([Link to OpenAPI Documentation](https://Contexter.github.io/FountainAI-API-Docs/docs/character.html))
   - Session and Context Management API ([Link to OpenAPI Documentation](https://Contexter.github.io/FountainAI-API-Docs/docs/session.html))
