### Central Sequence Service API Documentation

### Overview

The Central Sequence Service is a dedicated system that assigns, manages, and updates sequence numbers for various elements within a story (e.g., scripts, sections, characters, actions, spoken words). It ensures that everything happens in a logical order and maintains version history.

### Key Features

- **Sequence Numbers**: Unique identifiers that determine the order of elements within a story.
- **Reordering**: Changing the order of elements by updating their sequence numbers.
- **Versioning**: Tracking changes to elements over time, allowing you to maintain a history of modifications.
- **Cascading Updates**: Ensuring that when one element's order or version is updated, all related elements are updated accordingly to maintain consistency.

### Data Flow and Integration

The Central Sequence Service works by assigning sequence numbers to elements created by various APIs (**Core Script Management**, **Character Management**, **Session and Context Management**, **Story Factory**). It ensures that all elements follow a logical order and provides functionalities for reordering and versioning.

### Example of Usage

The following example json object shows how a dialogue exchange between characters within an established sequence is managed by the Central Sequence Service. Each element is assigned a sequence number to ensure a natural and logical reading flow.
