### API Documentation - Character Management API

### Overview

The Character Management API is designed to handle characters within screenplays, including their creation, management, actions, and spoken words. It integrates with the Central Sequence Service to ensure logical sequence numbers for each element, allowing a coherent flow within the story.

### Key Features

- **Retrieve All Characters**: Fetches a list of all characters stored in the system.
- **Create a New Character**: Allows for the creation of a new character.
- **Retrieve All Paraphrases for a Character**: Fetches all paraphrases linked to a specific character.
- **Create a New Paraphrase for a Character**: Allows for the creation of a new paraphrase linked to a character.
- **Retrieve All Actions**: Lists all actions stored within the system.
- **Create a New Action**: Allows for the creation of a new action entity.
- **Retrieve All Paraphrases for an Action**: Fetches all paraphrases linked to a specific action.
- **Create a New Paraphrase for an Action**: Allows for the creation of a new paraphrase linked to an action.
- **Retrieve All Spoken Words**: Lists all spoken words currently stored within the system.
- **Create a New Spoken Word**: Allows for the creation of a new spoken word entity.
- **Retrieve All Paraphrases for a Spoken Word**: Fetches all paraphrases linked to a specific spoken word.
- **Create a New Paraphrase for a Spoken Word**: Allows for the creation of a new paraphrase linked to a spoken word.

### Data Flow and Integration

The Character Management API relies on the Central Sequence Service to assign unique sequence numbers to each element (characters, actions, spoken words, paraphrases), ensuring a logical and coherent order within the story.

### Example of Usage

The following example shows a dialogue exchange between characters within an established sequence, managed by the Central Sequence Service. Each element is assigned a sequence number to ensure a natural and logical reading flow.

```json
{
  "characterId": 1,
  "name": "Juliet",
  "description": "The heroine of Romeo and Juliet.",
  "actions": [
    {
      "actionId": 1,
      "description": "Juliet stands on the balcony, looking out into the night.",
      "sequence": 1
    }
  ],
  "spokenWords": [
    {
      "dialogueId": 1,
      "text": "O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?",
      "sequence": 2
    }
  ],
  "paraphrases": [
    {
      "paraphraseId": 1,
      "originalId": 1,
      "text": "Juliet, the love interest of Romeo in the classic tale.",
      "commentary": "Adapted description for modern retellings.",
      "sequence": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### Detailed Breakdown: Step-by-Step Process

#### Initial Setup and Workflow

When the system is first set up, it will involve initializing each of the APIs and ensuring they are configured to communicate with the Central Sequence Service. Here's a step-by-step guide on how the system will work from the very beginning:

##### Step 1: Initialize Central Sequence Service

**Central Sequence Service** is the backbone of the entire system, responsible for generating and managing sequence numbers.

1. **Set Up the Service**: Deploy the Central Sequence Service and initialize it.
2. **Initialize Sequence Counter**: Start the sequence counter from 1 (or another starting point if specified).

##### Step 2: Set Up Core Script Management API

The **Core Script Management API** handles scripts, section headings, and transitions.

1. **Deploy the API**: Ensure the Core Script Management API is deployed and running.
2. **Connect to Central Sequence Service**: Configure the API to request sequence numbers from the Central Sequence Service.
3. **Create Initial Script**:
   - Use the API to create the first script, receiving a sequence number for the script itself.
   - Add section headings and transitions, each obtaining their sequence numbers from the Central Sequence Service.

##### Step 3: Set Up Character Management API

The **Character Management API** handles characters, their actions, and spoken words.

1. **Deploy the API**: Ensure the Character Management API is deployed and running.
2. **Connect to Central Sequence Service**: Configure the API to request sequence numbers from the Central Sequence Service.
3. **Create Initial Characters**:
   - Use the API to create the first characters, receiving sequence numbers for each.
   - Add actions and spoken words for each character, each obtaining their sequence numbers from the Central Sequence Service.

##### Step 4: Set Up Session and Context Management API

The **Session and Context Management API** manages sessions and character contexts.

1. **Deploy the API**: Ensure the Session and Context Management API is deployed and running.
2. **Connect to Central Sequence Service**: Configure the API to request sequence numbers from the Central Sequence Service.
3. **Create Initial Sessions and Contexts**:
   - Use the API to create initial sessions for characters,

 receiving sequence numbers for each session.
   - Add context data for characters, each context update receiving its sequence number from the Central Sequence Service.

##### Step 5: Set Up Story Factory API

The **Story Factory API** integrates data from the other APIs to assemble and manage the logical flow of stories.

1. **Deploy the API**: Ensure the Story Factory API is deployed and running.
2. **Connect to Other APIs**: Configure the API to fetch data from the Core Script Management API, Character Management API, and Session and Context Management API.
3. **Connect to Central Sequence Service**: Ensure the Story Factory API can retrieve sequence numbers from the Central Sequence Service.
4. **Assemble Stories**:
   - Fetch scripts, sections, characters, actions, spoken words, and contexts from the respective APIs.
   - Use the sequence numbers to assemble these elements into a coherent and logical story.
